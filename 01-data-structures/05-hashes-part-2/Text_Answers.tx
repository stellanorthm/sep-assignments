Other collision resolution methods:

Random hashing: The probe sequence is generated by the output of a pseudorandom number generator seeded by the key.

Coalesced Hashing: Forms a hybrid of both separate chaining and open addressing.

Separate chaining with other structures: Instead of a list, one can use any other data structure that supports the required operations.
